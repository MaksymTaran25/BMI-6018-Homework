# Operators 2

# Explain how the "+", addition operation works differently for integers and strings.

# How "+" works for integers - it just gives the sum of them
a = 7
b = 3
print(a + b)


# How "+" works for strings - it just concatinates them
c = 'Hello'
d = ' everyone!'
print(c + d)
